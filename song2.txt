You gon' die if you try
You just might get a little bit of trouble
K-N-I-F-E right in your side
You will never see me comin'
You gon' die if you try
You just might get a little bit of trouble
K-N-I-F-E right in your side
You will never see me comin'
I got a switch in my head, I go from livin' to dead
You got me seein' all red, now I'm becomin' a threat
I fuckin' heard what you said, I'll make you have some regrets
And no, I never forget, so now you have a few debts
